In exploratory data analysis, we have a collection or a data set which is just a set of numbers--say a one dimensional data set. For example, 
these could be the daily average number of minutes each user spends on the site, the number of times each of a collection of Data science tutorial videos 
was watched, or similar metrics.

We first proceed to note the summary statistics and we want to know how may data points are there, the smallest, the largest,the mean and the
standard deviation.

But this still may not yield the complete picture of what the data is trying to represent.A good next step would be to create a histogram in
which the data is grouped into discrete buckets and count how many points fall into each bucket:

def bucketsize(point,bucket_size):
    """floor the point to the next lower multiple of bucket_size"""
    return bucket_size * math.floor(point/bucket_size)
    
def make_histogram(points,bucket_size):
    """buckets the points and counts how many in each bucket"""
    return Counter(bucketsize(point,bucket_size) for point in points)
    
def plot_histogram(points,bucket_size,title=""):
    histogram = make_histogram(points,bucket_size)
    plt.bar(histogram.keys(),histogram.values(),width=bucket_size)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.show()
